# Kitchen Club
*Last modified 2017-08-24*

## Purpose
The goal of the club is to provide Olin students with good cooking equipment and fun cooking/baking events.

## Membership
Everyone is invited and can join. To join, simply be in the mailing list. Big events and equipment training will be advertised through public mailing lists so more people will know.

## Officers and Roles:
The head of Kitchen Club is known as the President. The President manages the mailing list, has the final say on club decisions and may appoint a cabinet or subcommittee to help with logistical issues such as purchases or advertisement as he/she sees fit.

## Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the President must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new President will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has occurred.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Right now we have a lot of equipment in the EH kitchen which are locked and the lock password is available to our members. We might buy some additional pots/food processor. We would also submit funding requests to buy food materials for specific cooking events. The main location we use would be the EH kitchen.

## Events and Activities
Baking Saturday/Sundays, cooking fest/competitions. Depending on time and availability of members.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the CCO Director.

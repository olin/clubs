#Midnight Riders
*Last modified 2017-09-04*

##Purpose
We exist solely to unicycle and teach others how to unicycle! Games such as tag and uni hockey are a good way to get exercise and unwind between meetings.

##Membership
The Midnight Riders are very informal - no commitment is required, but assistance with fixing unis is always appreciated. Members should email the list when going unicycling so that others may join!

##Officers and Roles:
Presidents of the Midnight Riders are responsible for keeping the storage area neat, unicycles repaired, and logistical issues taken care of / scheduled.

##Transition Protocol
We will discuss electing or appointing a new President at the end of the academic year.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club has traditionally shared a room in West Hall with OFAC for unicycle storage. At present, we own 10-15 unicycles, some of which need repair after the summer and last semester. Our purchases are usually limited to parts such as tubes, cranks, and pedals; new unicycle requests are rare.

##Events and Activities
The Midnight Riders generally hold open uni hours once a week, as well as impromptu sessions and unicycle lessons at Candidate's Weekends / Fall Open House.

##Amendment Procedure
In the event that any formal amendment needs to be made, discussion will take place first on the uni mailing list, and then (if necessary) in person in order to come to a conclusion.

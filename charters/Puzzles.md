##Officers and Roles
The quizmaster is the leader of the puzzles club. The quizmaster manages the mailing list, has the final say on club decisions and may appoint a cabinet or subcommittee to help with logistical issues such as purchases or advertisement as he or she sees fit.

##Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the quizmaster must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new quizmaster will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has occurred.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We will buying puzzles occasionally throughout the year for student use. We also may occasionally buy snacks. We will request money for these items.

##Events and Activities

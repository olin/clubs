#WHACK: Weapons-Handling-And-Combat-Kakistocracy (Fencing)
*Last modified 2016-08-14*

##Purpose
The purpose of WHACK is to allow Olin students to have a place to fence on campus. Many Oliners fenced before coming to school, but it is very difficult to travel to any clubs in the area.

##Membership 
WHACK is open to any member of the Olin campus who wishes to attend

##Officers and Roles
* President: schedules meetings, sends iCals, requests funding, maintains equipment, monitors meetings/safety

##Transition Protocol
At the end of each semester, if the President decides that they don't want to run the club anymore, they choose a successor: usually whoever wants to be the President of the club next.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Club materials are currently stored in blue bins which move around throughout campus depending on where the club meets. Next year, it would be lovely to have some kind of more permanent storage space (which we are working on). Next year, it is expected that there will be more equipment purchases as the club increases in size.

##Events and Activities
WHACK meets once a week just to have fun and fence

##Amendment Procedure
The charter of WHACK is pretty much decided by the President. However, if any members have the opinion that it should be changed, then they can bring that issue to the President and have it examined for change.

##Other
There is a possibility that WHACK may change it's name in the coming year to something more thematically appropriate.

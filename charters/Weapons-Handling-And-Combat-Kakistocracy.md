# WHACK: Weapons-Handling-And-Combat-Kakistocracy (Fencing)
*Last modified 2018-09-03*

## Purpose
The purpose of WHACK is to allow Olin students to have a place to fence on campus. Many Oliners fenced before coming to school, but it is very difficult to travel to any clubs in the area.

## Membership
WHACK is open to any member of the Olin campus who wishes to attend

## Officers and Roles
* President: schedules meetings, sends iCals, requests funding, maintains equipment, monitors meetings/safety

## Transition Protocol
At the end of each semester, if the President decides that they don't want to run the club anymore, they choose a successor: usually whoever wants to be the President of the club next.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Club materials are currently stored in blue bins which move around throughout campus depending on where the club meets. Next year, it would be lovely to have some kind of more permanent storage space (which we are working on). Next year, it is expected that there will be more equipment purchases as the club increases in size.

## Events and Activities
WHACK meets roughly once a week for people to practice fencing and participate in bouts. Meeting times will be at the discretion of the president and open to suggestion by members.

## Amendment Procedure
The charter of WHACK is pretty much decided by the President. However, if any members have the opinion that it should be changed, then they can bring that issue to the President and have it examined for change.

## Disbanding
In the event WHACK disbands, the materials should be stored until a new fencing club is created. The materials are fragile if used incorrectly, and it is important that they be treated with the respect they deserve.

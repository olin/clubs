# Olin Combat Robotics 
*Last modified 04-03-2017
## Purpose

Olin Combat Robotics Club organizes combat robotics events at Olin.

## Membership

As the club currently exists in the role of event organizer, membership does not extend beyond the club administrators.

## Officers and Roles

The only official role of Olin Combat Robotics is that of Administrator. Club Administrators are responsible for event organization and upkeep of club materials.

## Transition Protocol

In May, new club Administrators will be selected for the following year by existing Administrators.
In the event that no Administrator is selected, any Olin student is able to claim the club materials and become an administrator provided they have the intent of continuing the club.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Olin Combat Robotics has the goal of building a 4*4 foot robot combat arena and keeping bot-building supplies on hand.
We will fund what we can out of club funding and charge bot builders to cover the rest of the funding.
Materials will be stored in a location decided upon by the administrators - likely the administrators dorm rooms until a permanent space is found.

## Events and Activities

Olin Combat Robotics will aim to hold Robot Combat events twice a semester in the library at SLAC, as well as other build-type events aimed at encouraging more people to build robots.
## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure.  Anyone who wants to participate in discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.

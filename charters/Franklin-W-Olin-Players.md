*Last modified 2018-09-06*
*To be ammended come Spring Semester*

## Mission Statement
The Franklin W. Olin Players (FWOP) will strive to enhance the culture of the Olin College community through the medium of the performing arts.  FWOP-sponsored activities will be student-driven, emphasize the Olin ideal of balanced student interests, and serve to reach and involve the entire Olin community.

## Organizational Structure
The organization of FWOP shall consist of two decision making bodies: the Entire Membership and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of the four standing FWOP Officers (FWOPicers): President, Production Manager, and Marketing Director. During a production, the Board of Directors also includes the Theatrical Director and Technical Director for the particular show currently in production.

## Membership
There are no criteria for membership in FWOP.  Anyone interested may receive FWOP emails, attend meetings, and participate in FWOP activities.  A student may initiate membership in FWOP by joining the official FWOP mailing list, attending a meeting, or participating in a show.  One does not have to be a member of FWOP to participate in FWOP productions.  FWOP membership is not based on the level of a member's participation.

## FWOP Officers Roles and Responsibilities
### President [Elected once per year]
As the leader of FWOP, the President has the responsibility of calling and running FWOP meetings, initiating activities, following through with organizing members who volunteer to lead FWOP activities, and making executive decisions when necessary. The President coordinates with Student Activities, and Clubs (SAC) to decide on FWOP's budget. The President has the duty to enforce the FWOP Charter and all external arrangements and contracts made with other organizations and to ensure that all FWOP Officers are doing their jobs to the best of their abilities. The President shall have a working knowledge of the organizational structure and dynamics of FWOP's counterparts at Babson College and Wellesley College, and in cooperation with the Marketing Director, advertise FWOP's auditions and productions on the neighboring campuses near Olin College.
The President is the most public figure of FWOP and represents FWOP to the community.

### Production Manager [Elected once per year]
The Production Manager acts as the Vice President of FWOP and shall perform the duties of President when necessary. The Production Manager oversees the organization budget, coordinates with companies outside of Olin College to secure rights for FWOP productions, and is responsible for FWOP's collection of set and prop items. The Production Manager focuses on the practicality of the production. The Production Manager shall keep an accurate record of every meeting of the Board of Directors and of the Entire Membership, and shall also ensure that every meeting starts with a bang and ends on a high note.

### Marketing Director [Elected once per year]
The Marketing Director shall advertise FWOP auditions and productions to groups including but not limited to: Olin College students and parents, Babson students, and Wellesley students. The Marketing Director shall have a working knowledge of the marketing channels available at Olin, Babson, and Wellesley. The Marketing Director shall also maintain and update the FWOP website and Facebook page.

### Technical Director [Elected for each production]
The Technical Director reports to the Theatrical Director during a production and shall coordinate the sound and lighting design and operation for a production to the satisfaction of the Theatrical Director. The Technical Director shall be in charge of the technical team and shall have a working knowledge of the facility in which the production is being performed.

### Theatrical Director [Elected for each production]
The Theatrical Director directs a production and shall coordinate the actors, actresses, and technical team as they see fit. The Theatrical Director generally has final say over all matters of the production unless overruled by the Board of Directors or the President of FWOP.

## Additional Roles
The theatrical director and techincal director may appoint assistants as he or she sees fit during a production for such roles including but not limited to: costume designer, set designer, stuff master, stage manager, and musical director.

## Transition Protocol
In order for FWOP to continue running smoothly for many years to come, every FWOP Officer upon leaving office shall give a report either in writing or orally to their successor explaining the role and imparting the knowledge that the departing officer has learned.

## Elections
The President, Production Manager, Marketing Director, and Technical Director are elected late in the Spring semester prior to the year they take office.  This gives these officers the opportunity to plan FWOP events and direction during the summer, and also ensures that these four vitally important roles are filled by experienced members of FWOP.
The Theatrical Director is elected for the duration of one production when the Entire Membership and the Board of Directors see fit to create a production.
Elections are run during FWOP meetings or through the FWOP mailing list. There is no minimum number of members that must be present in order to run elections, but the elections must be well advertised to members in advance. Election voting records are not kept.

## Meetings of the Board of Directors
When the Entire Membership recommends productions to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors shall consider the production and make a final determination as to if FWOP should create the production. The Board of Directors shall weight the practicality, budgetary requirements, marketability, and student interest of each suggested production before taking a vote.
The Board of Directors shall have the authority to change FWOP organization policy but may be overruled by a majority vote of the Entire Membership.

## Production Selection
Members of FWOP shall have the power to suggest and recommend productions to the Board of Directors. Shows will be selected through a combination of a vote from the Membership and the willingness of multiple Members of FWOP to assume leadership responsibility for the production.
At the end of a semester, the Membership of FWOP will elect the Theatrical and Technical Director for the particular show that is beginning production next semester.
The Entire Membership may also assign tasks as necessary to its Officers and fellow members and change FWOP organization policy.
Votes of the Entire Membership require a majority of the members present to pass.

## In the Best Interests of FWOP
It is the President's responsibility to ensure that all FWOP Officers are performing their duties to the best of their abilities; therefore, in the event that a FWOP Officer has neglected their role, has been approached about the issue, and has failed to address it in a timely manner, to the detriment of the organization, the President has the responsibility for the sake of the organization to ask the FWOP Officer to resign. Only if absolutely necessary, the President has the power to remove a FWOP Officer from
position.
In the case of an open position between normal elections, the President may appoint an interim FWOP Officer to fill the role until the end of the production currently in progress. At the end of said production, if normal elections are not close at hand, a special election shall be called by the President at the next meeting of the Entire Membership. The special election must occur before the first rehearsal of the next production. If no production is in progress at the time of the vacancy, the special election shall be held immediately. The special election shall follow normal election procedures.
If any member of FWOP believes that the President is performing his or her role poorly, any member may challenge the President for their position. In the case of a challenge, a special meeting of the Entire Membership shall be called by the Production Manager where the Entire Membership shall elect either the challenger or the sitting President according to normal election procedures.

## Amendments
Amendments to the FWOP Charter may be proposed by any member for review at a meeting of the Entire Membership. The proposed amendment should be distributed in advance, and the meeting well-advertised to FWOP members (i.e. an email sent to all members).  The amendment will be discussed at the meeting, and a simple majority will be required to carry the amendment.

## Ratification
A majority vote at a meeting of the Entire Membership shall be required for ratification.

# Cryptography Club
## Purpose
The goal of cryptography club is to get interested Olin students involved in the important field of cryptography and cyber security. Main events will involve participating and planning for the MIT capture the flag competition October 25-27 and attended lectures from professors on the interdisciplinary topics of cryptography and cyber security on a student interest basis. We will also be solving puzzles. 
## Membership
Meet once a week or biweekly after October. Subject to meet additional times around competition time. Anyone with interest is encouraged to attend. Cryptography mailing list to come. 
## Officers and Roles
Organizer for the interdisciplinary talks and mailing list, the group participating in competition will have roles (monitoring and defense, attacking, etc.), treasurer to deal with money logistics for group events. 
## Transition Protocol
In the month of December, the Organizer must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next semester. At that time, the new Organizer will inform the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair that the transition has occurred.
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Space, TBD on a per meeting basis. Most likely in EH lounge when no other office hours are taking place. Snacks for talks, possible subsidizing for out of state professors to come and give talks. For the interdisciplinary talks, we will reserve a Olin classroom or auditorium. 
## Events and Activities
In the beginning of the semester we will gauge the interest in cryptography and cyber security to work on getting those interests met later during the semester. Heavy focus on capture the flag rules and team assignments in the beginning of the semester as well. Obviously, participation in MIT Capture the flag (CTF). 
## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the Director of Clubs and Organizations.

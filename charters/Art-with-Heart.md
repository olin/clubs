# Art with Heart
*Last modified 2016-09-01*

## Membership

Members of Art with Heart put on shows and other events wherein all the proceeds go to some form of community betterment project. The shows typically consist of a set of performances and a visual arts gallery. One show is done during Family Weekend, and a second is done sometime during the Spring semester. Other events include the annual Yule Ball, generally held on Friday night after classes for the Fall semester end, and a variety of volunteer activities that members may undertake. All artwork is produced by students and the club will decide together on where to send the money at the end of a given school year.

In order to make these events run smoothly, it is expected that members will attend meetings when they are called and participate in planning/discussion. These meetings will be infrequent - at most, twice a month on average - and thus should not be particularly difficult to commit to time-wise.

## Officers

There are 7 officers who will take point on the organization of all Art with Heart activities. The Secretary manages minutes for each AwH meeting and inventory for the club as a whole. The Treasurer keeps track of donations and ticket sales, making sure that all money given to AwH is accounted for and placed in the AwH account immediately after acquisition. Documentation of AwH funds is the responsiblity of the Treasurer. The Business Manager takes care of AwH's social media presence - taking photos, posting to the AwH instagram, capturing video of performances, etc. - and also covers community outreach. The Gallery Lead is in charge of ensuring that there are artists willing to contribute to the gallery, and caring for all gallery pieces as needed. The Performance Lead is in charge of ensuring that each performance has an adequate number of performers and that the performance will run smoothly. The President is the spearhead of new events, especially volunteer events, and also exists to help other officers complete the tasks assigned to them. If someone is lost or overwhelmed, they should be able to turn to the President. The President is also in charge of making sure the charter is up-to-date at the end of each year so that the next year can begin with a freshly evaluated charter.

## Transition Protocol

An election will be held at the end of each Spring semester in order to determine the officers for the following semester. No student may serve as an AwH officer in their final semester at Olin. As such, if a student serving as an officer in the Fall must be replace for the Spring, an election will be held for that position at the end of the Fall semester. Officers should know that they are committing to at least a semester, if not a year, of service as an officer - that being said, if the position becomes too much to handle, a special election can be held to replace any officer who gives two weeks notice of resignation from their position. Whenever a new officer is appointed, it is the responsibility of that new officer to schedule a transition meeting with their predecesor in order to go over all documentation, tips, etc. that relate to the position.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

It is unclear at the moment whether or not AwH has a deisgnated storage space. However, some items have been purchased for AwH's use, and all future purchases should be counted with these in the inventory.

## Amendment Procedures
Amendments to the charter may be made as long as the student who wishes to make a change brings it up with the President. The President will then propose the change to the club, and once the club has discussed the proposed change, everyone in attendance will vote on whether or not to implement it.

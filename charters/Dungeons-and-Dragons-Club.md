#Dungeons and Dragons Club
*Last modified 2017-09-04*

## Purpose
To facilitate games and/or discussion of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons (and other similar systems or tabletop RPGs)

## Membership
Must subscribe to the mailing list and respect club property.

## Officers and Roles
The President of DnD Club manages the mailing list and requests for additional equipment. The President must have a suitable title (High Stormlord, Worldshaper, etc.). Club members divide into smaller independent groups.

## Transition Protocol
The current president must select their successor (in whatever way they feel appropriate) before they leave Olin. The new president must then select a title that has not been used before by previous presidents.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club has a small storage space in a cabinet on the second floor lounge of East Hall. Please use the checkout sheet attached to the cabinet door. We can submit funding requests for additional dice, miniatures, boards, books, etc. Please let the club president know if you have any requests.

## Events and Activities
The nature of the club is such that each small group determines its own events and activities. The club may host player-finding or explanatory (what is DnD? Why should people be interested?) meetings to help form groups.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to the charter can be proposed to the president or list at any time. The president has final approval over any amendments.

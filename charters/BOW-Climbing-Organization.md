# BCO (BOW Climbing Organization)
*Last modified 2015-07-06*

## Purpose
Climbing fun for everyone! Our team will be founded on several key tenets: 

1. Diversity - BOW, All Skill Levels, All Backgrounds
2. Consistency - practicing on a weekly basis
3. Lowering the Barrier of Entry for Beginners
  a. Free Passes to Start
  b. Helping Fund and Kickstart a Climbing Career
4. Dont let consistency turn into monotony! i.e. Do more than indoor gym practices
  a. Taking skill building classes, like learning to Lead Climb.
  b. Participating in External Competitions (like B3 Boston Boulder Brawl) or Externally-hosted Climbing Events.
  c. Outdoor Climbing.
  d. Internally organized events (Holloween Dress Up Climb, Watch Reel Rock XX screenings together)

## Membership 
Every member should commit to 1-2 off campus practices at the gym each week. 

## Officers and Roles
Our president will be the final decision maker in all matters.  This individual will have an inner-circle of fellow leaders who will plan ad-hoc meetings.  We anticipate a majority of the work in 1) the organization of tryouts 2) structuring practices to match the skill levels and interests of the members 3) setting up internal competitions 4) managing transportation 5) managing funding 6) planning for external competitions.

Selected more experienced members will act as mentors to the beginners. Their responsibilities range from giving climbing technique seminars, to just giving simple advice on climbing routes. 

## Transition Protocol
In the month of December, the president must designate a successor, with nominations from other members, who will take over immediately until the next transition period. This internal transition will help for the new successor to learn the ropes, while the old successor is still there.  At the end of the spring semester, the new president will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has officially occurred.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
- Paying for a portion of gym membership ($44 per month per person)
- Gas reimbursements for transportation
- Basic communal equipment purchases: 
  - chalk bag + chalk ($20 per year) 
  - climbing rope
  - harnesses ($30 * 6)
- Subsidizing member purchases of equipment or lessons. Amount of subsidy will be determined on a case by case basis by the leaders. For example,
  - Subsidizing the cost of buying first time shoes, since this saves rental costs in the long run and encourages commitment in the sport. 
  - Subsidizing the cost of a lead climbing class. Stronger case if that person is willing to lead to set up top-rope routes for other outdoor members.

## Events and Activities
For each of these events and activities, having a person who drives their planning and execution will be crucial for their success. So, assume that "Outdoor Boulder Trip to Lincoln Woods, Rhode Island" will have a leader.
- External events/competitions like Boston Boulder Brawl or Collegiate Climbing Sleepover Night
- Outdoor climbing trips.  
- Social events
  - Post-practice dinner/dessert
  - Bring your Sibb/Friend to climbing day!
    - Help use up our free passes and to get more people introduced to climbing
  - And more! Members and leaders are always welcome to suggest more event ideas; leaders will provide advice and navigation to help make it happen if it's within an appropriate scope.

## Amendment Procedure
1. Propose an amendment to the current leaders
2. Leaders will meet and discuss, members welcome to join this discussion 
3. Leaders can either approve the amendment or if the amendment is determined as non-trivial, a vote will be cast.

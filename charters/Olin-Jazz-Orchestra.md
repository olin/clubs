*Last modified 2019-09-03*

## Purpose

OJO is a club for people that want be a part of a jazz big band at Olin. We will play both classic and contemporary big band music.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone, although it may be restricted if the band gets too big (or broken up into several, smaller bands). Members are required to attempt learning songs, and to show up to band practices with a willingness to improve.

## Officers and Roles

There will only be one role on the team and that is the club leader. They are responsible for managing purchases and ensuring that everyone knows when to meet.

## Transition Protocol

In April, the new club leader will be selected who will guide the next year's band. The next club leader is elected by a simple majority vote from the club members.

## Club Assets

  - OJO messenger chat
  - Big band music in the Jam Room bookshelf

## Purchases

We only purchase big band music for each semester. Around 3-4 charts at around $50 a piece leads to a rough budget of $175 a semester and $350 a year. This music is played then stored for future versions of the club to play in the future.

## Events and Activities

Weekly meetings occur to practice as well as one concert per semester. This concert is open to the public. In addition to these OJO is able to play at other events that we are requested to.

## Amendment Procedure

If members of OJO are unsatisfied with how the club is being run, or the rules the club is run by, this charter is open to being amended. More than half of the members must vote in approval of a change for the amendment to be passed.

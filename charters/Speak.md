#Speak
*Last modified 2015-05-30*

##Purpose
The purpose of Speak is to create a venue to encourage creative writing, reflection, and thought through the art of speaking and spoken word poetry.

##Membership
Anyone can be a member and take part in club events/meetings as much or as little as they like. Members will often attend one meeting a week, scheduled for an hour to discuss/read/write/listen.

##Officers and Roles
The only role currently in Speak is an organizer who will put together and host meeting times, make any necessary decisions, and organize events. If an organizer is not at Olin for a semester, he or she must choose another organizer to fulfill this role.

##Transition Protocol
In April, the organizer will chose a successor to hand the club over to and will inform SAC of the new organizer.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Generally, the club requires very little. Purchases may be made for larger events hosted (food etc) and the club may use SAC audio equipment on occasion for events. The club does not require any materials, purchases, or space for general activities.

##Events and Activities
Events such as open mics, workshops, or field trips to spoken word venues may occur throughout the year.

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the Director and Assistant Director of Clubs and Organizations.

Make A Game, Make Assets
Last Modified 8/8/2017

## Purpose
To unite people with a shared interest in game development or interactive
programming through game jams.

## Membership
Anyone can be a member, no prior experience is needed. There will be a
mailing list containing all members to announce upcoming events, and all
who are interested may join any event and become a member of the club.

## Officers and Roles
We believe in a horizontal leadership style. There will be no official "leaders" of the club.
There are only 2 responsibilities required within the club: curating
and moderating the mailing list, and club spending training. Both of
these positions can have any number of members greater than zero, and do not equate to
leadership of the club.

## Transition Protocol
As our horizontal leadership structure does not define leaders, the two responsibilities
within our club will be passed down to volunteering members of the club at their will.

## Materials, Purchases, and Spaces
The club requires a common space (typically the computer lab) for
members to participate in game jams. Purchases are made by a club member
who has been club spending trained following a club-wide majority vote on the
spending.

## Events and Activities
Game jams. This can include Ludum Dare, Global Game Jam, the One Hour Game Jam, etc.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments may be ratified by any member, provided the amendment passes a
club-wide vote by majority.

# German Club
(last modified 2016-09-01)

## Purpose: 
The purpose of German Club is to provide German speakers and learners at Olin with an opportunity to converse in the language and experience/discuss German culture.

## Membership: 
Anyone who would like to attend the weekly conversation tables or special events is a member. Members are welcome to attend as frequently or infrequently as they are able.

## Officers & Roles:
This is a fairly informal club; as such, there are no officers. The main role is that of weekly reminder email sender; at the time of writing, Lindsey and Sarah are sharing this responsibility.

## Transition Protocol:
A new email sender will be appointed at the end of each year - although it may happen that the same person is re-selected.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space:
For the most part, the club takes place at a table in the Dining Hall mezzanine; however, for special events, the club will use other common spaces on campus. Purchases will include cultural items such as food, books, and movies.

## Events & Activities:
The main activity is a weekly conversation table, however throughout the semester there may also be small events such as movie showings or food celebrations (e.g. around Oktoberfest or Karnival).

## Amendment Procedures:
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If the amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership present at the next conversation table, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the CCO directors.

#SLAC: Stay Late and Create
*Last modified 2015-05-30*

##Purpose
The goal of SLAC is to provide an open venue with resources, empowerment, and support for peer learning and personal projects.

##Membership
SLAC is an open club with all members invited to organize small seminars or courses and to participate in organizational discussions. By virtue of being a student, faculty member, or staff of Olin College, you are a ‘member’ of SLAC. 

##Officers and Roles
SLAC follows a loose organizational structure relying on the volunteerism and goodwill of general members and attendees to keep events happening and sustainable, under the leadership of the SLAC Guiding Council, headed by the SLAC President. Members of the SLAC Guiding Council are in charge of the mailing list, discussing and making major decisions, and appropriating tasks between members of the council for logistical items like purchases, event organization, or advertisement. 

In addition to overseeing the SLAC Council, it is the job of the SLAC President to guide and promote the general sustainability of the organization - finding good sources of funding, fostering and guiding relationships among the college’s staff and faculty, and maintaining detailed documentation of what has worked in the past, and what could be improved.

##Transition Protocol
The SLAC President must transfer all major responsibilities and decision-making power to a younger student prior to their last semester, preferably before then. This will ensure that the organization will continue to exist and thrive throughout the turnover of Presidents. 

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
SLAC provides snacks and drinks during weekly meetings and occasionally will purchase equipment for use on club projects and peer-led seminars. Most SLAC-sponsored events will be held in the library. Additional purchases will be made for the annual festival of creativity, SLACFest.

##Events and Activities
SLAC meets weekly to provide a venue for personal project work, peer-led tutorials and talks, as well as open-ended discussions of a wide variety of subjects. SLAC also serves as a central meeting place for several other clubs’ events and activities weekly. In addition to weekly meetings, SLAC also hosts an annual festival of creativity, SLACfest. The final area of focus of SLAC is the goal of working with other clubs and organizations to help put on events. 

##Amendment Procedure
The charter can be changed at any time with a reasonable consensus of the Guiding Council.

# Olin Weekend Warriors 
*Last modified 2016-08-14*

## Purpose

The purpose of OWW (Olin Weekend Warriors) is to have awesome nerf battles in the AC every week.

## Membership

OWW is open to anyone on Olin's campus (including professors and Babson students) provided they respect the rules of the Honor Code and the club

## Officers and Roles

President: plans meetings, sends iCals, makes purchases, organizes with Babson's nerf club for joint events

## Transition Protocol

At the end of each semester, if the President decides that they don't want to run the club anymore, they choose a successor: usually whoever wants to be the President of the club next.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

We have a large quantity of nerf-related items in the closet located in WH1. We will probably need to purchase at least some new darts this coming year, and there is a distinct possibility that some new nerf guns will also need to be purchased.

## Events and Activities

We meet once a week in the evenings and run around the AC with nerf guns. This coming year, we are planning on collaborating more with Babson's nerf club as well, to possibly have dual-campus events.

## Amendment Procedure

The charter of OWW is pretty much decided by the President. However, if any members have the opinion that it should be changed, then they can bring that issue to the President and have it examined for change.

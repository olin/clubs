# Magic the Gathering Club
*Last modified 9-12-16*

## Purpose
To sling spells and walk planes. (And be goddamn nerds by playing a children's card game)

## Membership
There's a mailing list for organizing events, but anyone who enjoys MTG can join.

## Officers and Roles
Grand Arbiter: This mage is responsible for organizing events and ordering product for drafts. Other roles can be created and responsibilities shared if necessary.

## Transition Protocol
The Grand Arbiter or other members of the club will decide on a new leader.

## Club Materials and Purchases
The WH3 closet has a large stock of miscellaneous commons and uncommons for deckbuilding, cubing, etc.
Boxes of booster product can be purchased by the Grand Arbiter for limited events. Cards opened in these events should be returned to the closet in WH3.

## Events and Activities
Drafts should be held at whatever frequency is convenient and affordable, preferably when 6, 8, or 10 people are available.
Club members are encouraged to organize group outings to FNM and/or prereleases when desired.

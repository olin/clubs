## Purpose
The purpose of this club is to create a community of runners that help Oliners:
  1. Get and stay in shape
  2. Find training partners
  3. Share running tips and information
We are also planning to participate in races through NIRCA (the National Intercollegiate Running Club Association).

## Membership

## Events and Activities
Weekly meetings: There will be a biweekly club-wide meeting where everyone can get together to talk, organize runs, and anyone can get information about the club and the running groups.

## Officers and Roles
President: Organize club-wide meetings on a regular basis and make club purchases.

## Transition Protocol
Every April a new president and treasurer will be elected.

## Club Materials and Purchases
Partially cover race entrance fees and transportation costs, running team jerseys, and NIRCA membership fees.

## Amendment Procedure
Any club member can propose an amendment. If the amendment has the support of the majority of the club, the president will submit the amendment to the CCO.

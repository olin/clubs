# Jewish Organization at Olin

*Last modified 09/9/2019*

## Purpose
To have an alive Jewish culture on campus. To educate Jews and non-Jews about Jewish culture and practices. To create an environment where Jews feel comfortable.

## Membership
The membership can come in various forms. We have a groupchat that has over 30 members for coordinating and planning events. Even more people from outside the groupchat/mailing list attend our events as well. Our goal is to provide an environment where Jews and non-Jew can come and experience Jewish culture with no commitment.

## Officers and Roles:
The president(s) of JOO club is in charge of planning events, budgeting and delegating as well as communicating with the CCO or Hillel for needed funding.

There may also be a vice president(s) role whose job it to help the president(s) with planning and exicuting events and also learning in order to maintain some continuity within the club.

## Transition Protocol
The president(s) will be passed down from year to year to a qualified candidate willing to accept the responsibility. If there are multiple candidates, we will have a discussion/ vote to decide the either who the president is, and whether or not we should have a co-presidency.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We need a little bit of storage space, currently in the closet of EH1. We have in the past made purchases for reusable Judaica. Now we will likely just need funding for events.

## Events and Activities
Our events often celebrate the Jewish holidays in inclusive ways. We also will have some Jewish culture events where we will cook Jewish foods together.

## Amendment Procedure

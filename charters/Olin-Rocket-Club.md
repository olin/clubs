**Olin Rocket Club Charter**

**Purpose**
The goal of the rocket club is to create and improve on all parts of a student designed rocket/payload project. 

**Membership**
To become a member, any student may interview into a specific subsystem team. The club will provide information on those subsystems to potential new members.

**Officers**
The club is divided into different subsystems required for rocket design. As of 9/11/17 the subsystems are: Electrical/Software, Fabrication, Fault Protection, Chemistry, and Legal. The Subsystems are headed by subsystem leads who are advised and guided by the Systems Engineer. The Project Manager is in charge of the Systems Engineer and the clubâ€™s health and administrative standing in general. The Project Manager is the primary contact for the club (aka president).

**Transition Protocol**
The club shall go through voting procedure before the end of the final assessments period of the Spring semester. For the following procedure it is assumed that all seniors are unavailable for election (because they will be gone). 

*Subsystem Leads Election Process*:
members of the subsystems will vote to elevate one of their own to the position of subsystem lead for their particular subsystem (e.g. Fabrication will chose a Fabrication lead for the next year). The person elected to be subsystem lead can be vetoed however by an agreement between the current Project Manager and Systems Engineer. This can be overturned with a unanimous vote by all current subsystem leads.
 
 *Project Manager and Systems Engineer Election Process*:
All current subsystem leads, the current Project Manager, and the current Systems Engineer may nominate any one member of the club to the position of Project Manager and Systems Engineer respectively. These same people then vote on the nominees (pending they accept the nomination).

**Club Materials, Purchases, and Space**
The club shall use the tools/facilities of the college at all available opportunities. That being said, we are building a rocket which requires the majority of the funds the club will request. For storage, we are looking into a space at this time. The charter shall be amended accordingly and nothing will be purchased that needs to be stored until a space is found.

**Events and Activities**
The club shall meet as a whole for the Fall semester of the 2017-2018 school year, as we all gain knowledge on how to build a rocket. After that point, when the club begins to gain new members, Subsystems Teams will meet separately with Subsystem Leads, the Systems Engineer, and the Project Manager meeting weekly to discuss overall strategy.

**Amendment Procedure**
Amendments may be proposed by the Subsystem Leads, System Engineer, and Project Manager at the weekly strategy meeting. Upon a proposition a vote will take place involving the Leads, SysE, and Project Manager. The amendment is passed with a simple majority vote.

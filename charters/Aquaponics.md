# Olin Aquaponics
*Last modified 2016-7-16*

## Purpose

Olin Aquaponics is the child of the clubs Net Impact and Olin Workshop in the Library. Our purpose is to both bring awareness and do our
part in creating a sustainable environment by designing aquaponic systems for the Olin Library, which are energy-sustainable aquacultures that
can grow plants and raise marine life with minimal waste and energy input. The goal is to eventually have an Aquaponics Shelf in the Olin
Library. 

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone. Members are expected to attend weekly meetings, and be willing to participate in occasional trips to
buy supplies, volunteer for the local sustainability community, or offer an extra hand to maintain the systems we create.

## Officers and Roles

High-Involvement: Coordinating with the Library, Planning and Designing the System, Volunteering to help with Local Communities,
Supply Inventory, and Being on Call in case of needed System Maintenence.

Low-Commitment: Attending weekly meetings to help with the system where needed

The main dichotomy is that high involvement members are those who are deeply enthusiastic about this project and consistently
participate, thus they will be given the privilege of being involved in decision making and designing of the system, and they have a say
in the direction of the club. Low-commitment members like the project and are interested but don't want it to be a time sink,
thus they can come and go as they please, and attend weekly meetings as helping hands.

There will be two club leaders in charge of club maintenance, purchasing, and high-involvement scheduling, and while taking the leadership
position to make the final decisions on club direction, will still listen to the input of high involvement members to generate a holistic
decision.

## Transition Protocol

In March/ April, new club leaders will be selected for the following year.  Leaders will be chosen by a vote from the club members or by
whomever the previous club leaders deem are the most capable of leading the club, whichever sets the club on the best path for next year.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

To build this system, many materials will be required, and they may change as we iterate on the design process. For now, in general
materials include wood, bins, PVC, screws, bolts, nuts, lighting, rubber piping, wall outlets, and plants as well as their ecological
supplments.

All supplies will need to be purchased, whether through nearby stores or through online vendors. The club will ask to be funded by CCO
and a reimbursement process is established to handle purchases.

The club currently uses the Workroom in the Downstairs Library as its design studio.

## Events and Activities

Aquaponics holds weekly meetings where members meet to work on the system, which includes designing and building. Outside
events, such as shopping trips, volunteering at sustainable communities, and coordinating with the library will occur occasionally.

There will also be campus-wide Pesto activities (potentially others, depending on what we grow), where the college can come to enjoy the
fresh plants we have grown. We may potentially coordinate with ACRONYM or other organizations to make it a more social event. These will
occur on a much more occasional basis.

## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure.  Anyone who wants to participate in discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.

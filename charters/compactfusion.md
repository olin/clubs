# Olin Compact Fusion (OCF)

*Last modified 2019-08-04*

## Purpose

To gain skills in planning, simulating, managing, and executing the construction of a compact fusion reactor within a school semester.

## Membership

Anyone is available to join Olin Compact Fusion (OCF).

## Officers and Roles

A president manages OCF and is responsible for finances, space, and equipment storage. As the club develops, OCF will have a lead for each of its internal divisions and two primary leaders that manage administrative and budget-related tasks. These will be determined once a final roster is ready.

## Transition Protocol

OCF will actively track participation and interest of its members and the leadership group will select new leaders for the following year in a "Board Vote" where "board" members are determined by their involvement level in the club throughout the year.

## Club Assets

  - Locked storage cabinet on the 3rd floor of the CC
  - Equipment shared with Olin physics and engineering department
  - Equipment and lab setup at the Foundry

## Purchases

We will be purchasing - in tandem with the school - the minimal necessary physics equipment like vacuum chambers and vacuum equipment as well as electronics and other experiment-related physics equipment. We plan to max out club budget ~$500 and will seek funds through SAG, the Foundry, and other 

## Events and Activities

OCF will have weekly meetings in the AC and MH as well as a demo day at the Olin Expo.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter with a pull request on GitHub or
by emailing the OCF lead or any CCO director.

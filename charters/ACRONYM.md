# The ACRONYM
*Last modified 2016-09-01*

## Purpose

The Acronym offers coffee, tea, and conversation to the community for free.  Our goal is to foster a campus culture that supports the community’s needs for a relaxed space for idea generation and sharing.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone.

## Officers and Roles

High-Involvement: Baristas, Media/Communication, Event Coordinators, Buyers

Low-Commitment: Bakers, Music

High-involvement roles will be filled by consistently participating members.

There will be two club leaders in charge of club maintenance, purchasing, and high-involvement scheduling.

## Transition Protocol

In April, new club leaders will be selected for the following year.  Leaders should not be seniors except for in extenuating circumstances.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The pop-up coffeeshop will be hosted in the Milas Hall Atrium, as per Facilities’ permission.  Consumables for the coffeeshop will need to be purchased on a somewhat regular basis.  We are seeking to establish relationships with our tea and coffee suppliers.

## Events and Activities

The Acronym will host a pop-up coffeeshop on a weekly basis, and will host coffee and tea education seminars more irregularly.

## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure.  Anyone who wants to participate in discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.

*Last modified 2019-9-8*

## Purpose

ACRONYM offers coffee, tea, and conversation to the community for free. Our goal is to foster a campus culture that facilitates serendipitous interaction and discussion among all members of the community, including students, faculty, and staff.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone.

## Officers and Roles

Standard-Involvement: Baristas, Buyers

High-Involvement: Event Coordinators, Media/Communication, Finance Officers, President

High-involvement roles (board members) will be filled by consistently participating members and will be responsible for club functions.

## Transition Protocol

In April, new board members will be selected for the following year.  Leaders should not be seniors except for in extenuating circumstances. Leaders from previous years should be present for selecting new board members.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The coffeeshop will be hosted in the Milas Hall Atrium, as per Facilities’ permission and the club will strive to improve the space to better fulfill our purpose.  Consumables for the coffeeshop will need to be purchased on a somewhat regular basis by designated buyers.

## Events and Activities

ACRONYM will host a pop-up coffeeshop on a weekly basis. There will be additional club meetings that offer tastings and trainings to improve our ability to act on our goals. Special pop-up events may be hosted per request of other members of the College.

## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure.  Anyone who wants to participate in discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.

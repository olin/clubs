##Membership
Members can be anyone who is interested in learning about Taiwanese culture. They should attend at least two events a semester.

##Officers and Roles
The club will have a president and co-presidents. They manage the mailing list, have the final say on club decisions and may appoint a cabinet or subcommittee to help with logistical issues such as purchases or advertisement as they see fit. They are also in charge of organizing all events for the club.

##Transition Protocol
In April, the president and vice-president will designate successors for the following year. The new president and vice-president will take over immediately, but the existing president and vice-president will remain on the board until the end of the school year as support.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Any materials purchased by the club will be accessible to all of its club members.

##Events and Activities
Events and activities will happen on at least a monthly basis. They could include celebration of holidays, movie nights, playing games, or club outings related to Taiwanese culture. 

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.

##Other
"TAO will remain as TAO, with its interests and activities based mainly in Taiwanese-related events. We will maintain (not actively) that Taiwan is not a part of China. We'll celebrate what makes Taiwanese culture different from other East Asian cultures.

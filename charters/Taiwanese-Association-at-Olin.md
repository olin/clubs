They are also in charge of organizing all events for the club.

##Transition Protocol:

Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.

##Other
"TAO will remain as TAO, with its interests and activities based mainly in Taiwanese-related events. We will maintain (not actively) that Taiwan is not a part of China. We'll celebrate what makes Taiwanese culture different from other East Asian cultures.

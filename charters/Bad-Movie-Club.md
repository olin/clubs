# Bad Movie Club

*Last modified 2020-09-16*

## Purpose

To watch, discuss, and appreciate low budget and otherwise terrible movies.

## Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend our meetings. We will build a library of bad movies 
for students to watch on their own time if they are unable to attend meetings, 
or cannot attend for pandemic-related reasons.

## Officers and Roles

Decisions about what movies are to be watched will be decided by the group during meetings.
A treasurer will be appointed at the start of each year to keep track of club expenditure and to
provide guidance on what purchases are to be made.

## Transition Protocol

As new members join and others leave, the login information for where the movies are
stored are shared so that the library of bad movies can continue as our legacy upon
the world.

## Club Assets

- the olinbadmovieclub@gmail.com email account and related google drive folder
- The amazon account containing bad movie purchases


## Expected Purchases

We generally purchase a movie for every week ($12/week) until a critical mass of movies is collected, but this
serves as an initial investment, as those movies will then be available for any students who
want to watch them in the future.

## Events and Activities

Meetings are expected to occur weekly, but can vary based on interest and course load of
those attending.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter with a pull request on GitHub or
by emailing the current Head/Tail or any CCO director.

## Code of Conduct

All club members are expected to follow the Olin Honor Code in all activities.

Members are expected to help clean up the meeting space after each meeting.

Additionally, all club members are expected to adhere to the following
pledge, adapted from the [Contributer Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

#Astronomy Club
*Last modified 2016-09-01*

##Purpose
The goal of the club is to organize star viewing parties on campus with a Celestron Orange tube telescope, with naked eyes and star watching software. 

##Membership
Everyone is invited and can join. To join, simply be in the mailing list. Big events will be advertised through public mailing lists so more people will know. 

##Officers and Roles:
The head of Astronomy Club is known as the President. The President manages the mailing list, has the final say on club decisions and may appoint a cabinet or subcommittee to help with logistical issues such as purchases or advertisement as he/she sees fit.

##Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the President must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new President will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has occurred. 

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Right now we have a Celestron reflector telescope (the orange tube) that belongs to Judy (Xiaozheng) Xu. We might want to buy some binoculars, astro magazines or another telescope for the club in the future. 
We might buy some hot chocolate and other snacks for the star parties.

##Events and Activities
Star parties once a month, or once two weeks in the warmer months. Ocassionally if there's interest we might organize a trip to a dark sky retreat, join an amature astronomy group retreat, or go listen to some astronomy talks. 
The mailing list can also be used to share exciting astronomy news / jokes.

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time by the president.

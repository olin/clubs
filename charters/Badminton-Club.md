# Badminton Club
*Last Updated 2019-09-03*

## Purpose
The goal of Badminton club is to provide an environment in which people interested in badminton can come together and play together. We plan to meet twice a week, and go to PepsiCo court at the Babson Gym. Depending on interest, more serious members can become members of the Magnus Badminton Club(only 7 minutes away from Olin) to play with other professional players. A big priority is to coordinate with Babson's club, perhaps even host joint tournaments, as well as join them for external competitions.

## Membership
Any member can be a part of Badminton club to play in Babson. However, repeated professional playing at Magnus center will require a Magnus club membership (smaller subgroup of badminton club). Exact fees haven’t been calculated yet, but will be prorated per event to be less than 20 dollars per person.	This may or may not happen, depending on interest.

## Officers and Roles:
A president and vice president of Badminton Club work together to contact Babson as well as Magnus Club to coordinate playing times. We then relay this information back to members of the club to go over at specified weekly times.

## Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the president and vice president hold a meeting to discuss and designate successors, who will take over at the start of the next school year. At that time, the new president will inform CCO that the transition has occurred.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Most of the important materials we need is taken care of by Babson(their courts). A couple extra cheap stock racquets may be needed for new and casual members to make use of. A check-out system probably will not be needed: people can just keep the racquets in the ball room and responsibly put them back at the end of an event during club outings. We will submit funding requests if we need to restock. Each person may need an event fund of less than or about 20 dollars.

## Events and Activities
We plan to have weekly events at Babson PepsiCo (perhaps Magnus Club, depending on interest) during which a group of us walk or bike over to the locations in order to play badminton for an hour or two.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership,or is agreed upon by the president and VP, it passes and the revised charter will be submitted as a pull request to the Olin Clubs repo.

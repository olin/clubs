# Silly Oliners Doing Improv Und Magick (SODIUM)
*Last modified Sep 2019*

## Purpose

SODIUM serves to provide comedic entertainment to the Olin community, as well as teach its members the essentials of longform improv comedy.  Its members travel to perform with other college troupes, compete, and seek out coaching and demonstrations from professional comedians.

## Membership

Auditions are held at the beginning of each academic year and somewhere from 6-10 troupe members are chosen. Troupe members commit to two 2-hour practices per week and a 1-hour bonding block per week. SODIUM members also commit to putting on a 30-90 minute show for the Olin community every month.

## Officers and Roles

SODIUM has two co-leaders who run practice, investigate opportunities, and organize logistics for travel/growth, and plan/advertise shows. One of them is the budget manager.

## Transition Protocol

If one of the two co-leaders is graduating, the troupe votes in April for a replacement. The younger of the co-leaders traditionally leads most practices and steps up organizationally under the guidance of the elder co-leader so that they can learn the ropes.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The club needs no materials for regular meetings, but will request funding for sessions with a professional coach and admission to College Improv Tournament in the fall and College Comedy Fest in the spring. For these events, the club will also request transportation costs reimbursement. For special team bonding events, the club will request funds for food.

## Events and Activities

SODIUM puts on shows and workshops, and sometimes hosts other improv troupes. Its members travel to jam with other improv troupes and go into Boston to watch adults do improv.

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time by any member. We will talk it over and get communal agreement on a change; if there is division, we'll take a vote and pass the amendment if there's greater than 50% approval.

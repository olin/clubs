#TARDIS (Totally Awesome and Ridiculous Doctor-Inspired Stuff)
*Last modified 2016-08-26*

##Purpose
To celebrate The Doctor. Tardis gathers weekly to enjoy episodes of Doctor Who, play who-themed games, and debate the details of the Who-Verse. Also to complain about Stephen Moffat.

##Membership
No commitment necessary. Just show up once a week if you feel like. Usually saturday nights but we bounce around if there's another conflicting event.

##Officers and Roles
The only notable Officer is the club president(s), who may choose the title The Doctor, The Master, or Lord President of the High Council of the Time Lords. Basically they are in charge of organizing events.

##Transition Protocol
The President nominates a successor when they graduate, take a leave of absence, study abroad, or no longer wish to be awesome.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Tardis events will either be held in suites, rooms, or lounges depending upon the formality of the event. Most spending money will be used for food, and some may be used to purchase Doctor Who related media the club may be interested in seeing.

##Events and Activities
Weekly meetings based on when episodes come out, with special events when special events relating to Doctor Who occur.

##Amendment Procedure
Anyone can propose an amendment, which will be voted upon. The president must make the official changes.

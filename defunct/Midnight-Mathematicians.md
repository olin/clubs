# Midnight Math
*Last modified 2018-09-03*

## Purpose
At Olin, math is generally perceived as a means to an end. A field of mathematics is not deemed worth studying unless some immediate usefulness can be gleaned from it. The Midnight Mathematicians intend to be a counterpoint to this mentality. Alongside their regular math curriculum, we believe students deserve a glimpse at more extraordinary kinds of mathematics, even if the application of this math is not immediately obvious.

## Membership
Membership is determined by the mailing list.

## Officers and Roles:
There shall be, in charge of all that needs charging, two administrative positions to be filled: The Minister of Primes, and the Prime Minister. They will be ultimately responsible for ensuring that each Midnight Math lecture happens in a classy manner. In the event that the Prime Minister or the Minister of primes is absent, the other will bear the sole responsibility of ensuring the club runs smoothly. 

It shall be the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Primes to maintain a google doc for the keeping track of who give lectures on what when.  This google doc is editable by all, so anyone can sign up to give a lecture. It shall be the responsibility of the Minister of Primes and the Prime Minister to assign dates to proposed lectures.

## Transition Protocol
In the event that either the Minister of Primes or the Prime Minister steps down from his/her position (at any time), it shall be the duty of the person stepping down to assign his role to a suitable replacement.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
All our purchases are food (cheese, crackers, fancy beverages) and items related to these. Plates, cups, etc. can be kept from event to event; food needs to be purchased each time.

We generally meet in the fourth floor West Hall lounge on Saturday nights and have no additional space requirements.

## Events and Activities
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any point. A meeting will be called through the mailing list at least a week in advance, and any amendment with a vote of support from at least 50% of those in attendance will pass.

## Dress Code
Politeness is an integral part of classiness. Any exclusion of attendees based on "unclassy" dress is, in and of itself, the epitome of unclassiness. Thus, it shall be mandatory that a dress code not be mandated.

## Faculty Lectures
The Midnight Mathematicians intend to be a separate entity from the regularly scheduled math program at Olin. We do not wish to be a mere extension of the math which is already readily available and well-taught at Olin. However, we recognize that it is the medium which drives the message, and that Midnight Math provides a new mode of presenting math which distinguishes itself from the classroom regardless of the speaker. Further, Olin has a treasure trove of knowledgeable faculty members who can make valuable contributions to the group. Therefore, once per year, each faculty member will be permitted to give a lecture for the midnight mathematicians.

For the sake of equality, all faculty members will be contacted requesting a Midnight Math lecture, and those who are willing to give a lecture will be scheduled for a slot which fits with their schedule. Faculty lectures will be special events, which will not necessarily be held at the regularly scheduled time of midnight on Saturdays.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any point. A meeting will be called through the mailing list at least a week in advance, and any amendment with a vote of support from at least 50% of those in attendance will pass.

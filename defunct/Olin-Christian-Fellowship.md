# Olin Christian Fellowship
*Last updated 2019-09-13*

## Purpose

Olin Christian Fellowship (OCF) is an organization that exists to unite and serve the Christian community at Olin in an official capacity by fostering a supportive, Christ-like environment and by providing activities which encourage Christ-like growth and fellowship within the Christian community at Olin. The purpose of OCF is to support and encourage Christians on campus to follow Jesus’s teachings, including the following: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,” “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-38) and “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you”(Matthew 28:16-20).

## Membership

Membership in the Olin Christian Fellowship is granted to any persons wishing to consider themselves part of that community.

In any case where an official membership list or member count must be generated, such as for OCF related activities or administrative reasons, all subscribers to the christianclub@lists.olin.edu mailing list currently attending Olin College will be counted as members.

## Officers and Roles

The president is the only elected position in the Olin Christian Fellowship. The president serves as a liaison between the Olin Christian Fellowship and the Olin student government or administration of Olin College. The responsibilities of the president include the following:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Performing administrative tasks required by the student government or school administration</li>
  <li>Maintaining communication with the student government or school administration throughout the school year, as necessary</li>

  <li>Overseeing the charter revision process (Section 7)</li>
</ol type="a">

## Transition Protocol

The election process for the president must begin no later than four weeks prior to the last day of classes in the spring semester each year and conclude prior to the final day of classes. The election process should proceed in the following manner: 
<ol type="a">
  <li>No later than four weeks prior to the last day of classes in the spring semester, an announcement soliciting nominations for the role of president must be sent to the Olin Christian Fellowship mailing list by the current president.</li>
  <li>If the sitting president intends to run for reelection, the president must appoint another member of the Olin Christian Fellowship to oversee the election. In this case, the overseer will be responsible for the subsequent steps in the election process.</li>
  <li>Nominations for the role of president may come from any individual who is counted as a member of the Olin Christian Fellowship and should be sent to the overseer of the election. An individual is permitted to nominate him or herself for the role of president. The nomination period should last no longer than two weeks.</li>
  <li>At the end of the nomination period, the overseer of the election process must contact each of the nominated individuals to obtain an acceptance of the nomination.</li>
  <li>Once all nominees have accepted or rejected their nomination, an announcement containing the names of the candidates must be sent by the election overseer to the list. This announcement must also contain a date for the election. The election should be scheduled no sooner than 5 days following this announcement, but must occur prior to the last day of classes.</li>
  <li>In the event that there is only one candidate, that candidate shall be automatically elected to the office of President.</li>
</ol type="a">
The newly elected president holds a one-year term, beginning when election results are decided and ending when the election is held the following year.

There is no restriction on individuals considering study away from being nominated or elected to the role of president. As study away or leave of absence scenarios can be widely varying, detailed provisions for this scenario have not been included in this document. The sitting president will be expected to work out the details of the process if this situation arises.

In any case where grievances with the OCF President related to his or her duties as such arise, the matter should first be dealt with in a manner that is consistent with the procedures outlined in Matthew 18:15-17. Should attempts to resolve the matter in this way fail, and the only reasonable solution is the removal of the President from his or her duties, any collective of two or more OCF members shall have the right to call a meeting of the OCF community for an impeachment. At this meeting, the collective members who called the meeting shall publicly announce their grievances to the OCF community in a formal hearing and discussion. The OCF President shall attend this meeting, and shall have the right to defend his or herself during the hearing and discussion. At the end of the meeting, if no other solution has been reached, a vote shall be held to decide whether the President should be removed from office. A ¾ majority vote shall be required to remove him or her, at which point all his or her powers as President shall be removed. The community shall then hold an election for a new OCF President, immediately starting the procedures outlined in Section 5 and resolving them as quickly as is practically possible.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

OCF has bibles, books, CDs, and some event materials (paper and plasticware, decorations, etc.) in the designated EH3 storage space, and a few books on a designated shelf in the library.

## Events and Activities

An initiative is any regularly scheduled, OCF-endorsed event (e.g. a men’s or women’s small group, Bible study, praise and worship, etc.). 

Any member of OCF may run an existing initiative or propose to start a new OCF-endorsed initiative. The member who proposes the initiative shall be the leader of the initiative if it is approved. Once an initiative leader is no longer able or willing to lead that initiative, the initiative leader shall, based on his or her discretion, choose a member of the OCF community as a successor and shall immediately inform the president of the change in initiative leadership.

The OCF president will receive all proposals for new OCF initiatives. The president will, in a timely fashion, either approve or deny the proposal for a new OCF initiative based on the initiative’s accordance with the OCF Mission Statement. The president is encouraged to consult with members as needed during the approval process.

An initiative leader may request funding for his or her initiative. The President shall allocate OCF funds to each initiative as he or she deems appropriate.

The president may at any time revoke OCF endorsement of an initiative if he or she deems it to no longer be in accordance with the OCF Mission Statement. The president should consult OCF members before making such a decision.

## Amendment Procedure

Any member of the OCF community may submit a proposal for an amendment to the OCF charter. An amendment may be an addition to a section to the charter, a revision of a current section of the charter, or a complete rewrite of the charter. 

Proposals shall be submitted to the president during the presidential nomination period outlined in section 5. Submitted proposals shall be sent out to the community for review at the same time the presidential candidates are presented, as outlined in section 5.

Submitted proposals shall finally be presented, reviewed, discussed, and voted on at the presidential election outlined in section 5. Submitted proposals may be altered at any time before the vote by the submitter of the proposal, without requiring a vote, but all alterations shall be presented, reviewed, and discussed at the presidential election before the final vote.

Any proposal may pass by simple majority vote, and upon passing shall immediately take effect.

All proposals shall be voted on and resolved prior to the final election of the new OCF president.

Should it be imperative that a revision to the charter be made before the presidential election, any OCF community member may submit said revision to the president and request that revision procedures begin immediately, following a format similar to that outlined above.

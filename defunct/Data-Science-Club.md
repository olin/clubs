# Data Science Club
*Last modified 2018-02-19*

## Purpose
The Data Science club strives to create a friendly learning environment for people interested in data science. 
Data science involves applying statistics and machine learning techniques to analyze complex data sets and gather insights from data. 
The Data Science club will accomplish this by participating in data science competitions and connecting with data scientists outside of Olin. 
The club’s goal is to promote a better understanding of statistical methods and how they may be interpreted in the context of the input dataset.

## Membership
Any student within the BOW community can join the Data Science club. 
There are no criteria for membership. 
Anyone who is interested may sign up for the mailing list and attends meetings.
However, not all members will be able to attend the competitions due to individual time restraints.
Even so, the Data Science club does not differentiate between inactive and active members.

## Officers and Roles
The organizational structure of the Data Science club consists of two decision making subunits: the Entire Membership and the Leadership Team.
The Leadership Team consists of two Data Science officers: President and Vice President.

### President (elected once per semester)
The President is the main event coordinator in the club.
He/she is in charge of arranging the data science competitions and managing all club communications that occur outside of the BOW community. 
The President also has the responsibility of running the Data Science club meetings, initiating activities, and making an executive decision when necessary. 
The President is in charge of enforcing the charter and represents the Data Science club to the outside community.

### Vice President (elected once per semester)
The Vice President is the budget manager who is responsible for maintaining organization finances and keeping track of reimbursements and p-card expenses. 
He/she also coordinates all of the internal club communications, such as promoting the club and managing the club meeting agendas. 
The Vice President will fill in for the President if the need arises.

## Transition Protocol
At the end of every semester, the President and Vice President will nominate several possible leadership candidates for the next semester. 
From there, the entire club will vote on the next President and Vice President. 
Elections will be run during the second to last Data Science club meeting for the semester.
There is no minimum number of members that must be present for a valid election. 
Voting is completed through an anonymous Google survey. 
Every departing officer will give a report to his/her successor explaining the role and passing on any pertinent advice.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The Data Science club does not require any club materials. Most of our activities can be completed with a computer. 
In terms of purchasing, food may need to be acquired for special events (i.e. first meetings and guest lectures). 
Additional purchases include transportation to events and data science conferences. 
The Vice President is in charge of all of the club purchases. 
The only space the club needs is an empty classroom in the Academic Center.

## Events and Activities
Club meetings will occur at least once a week. 
These meetings come in several different forms, including member presentations on a data science topic of interest, adviser (Allen Downey) presentations on more complicated data science topics, work time for team competitions, guest lectures, and field trips to data science companies and conferences. 
The team competitions will be collectively selected from Kaggle or DrivenData. 
Potential presentation topics range from machine learning to bioinformatics.

## Amendment Procedure
At any point in the semester, anyone in the club can propose an amendment to the charter. 
If the amendment is approved by a majority of the club members after a discussion, then it will be added to the charter.

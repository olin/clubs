*Last modified 2017-09-06*

## Purpose
Climbing fun for everyone! Our team will be founded on several key tenets: 

1. Diversity - BOW, All Skill Levels, All Backgrounds
2. Consistency - practicing on a weekly basis
3. Lowering the Barrier of Entry for Beginners
  a. Free Passes to Start
  b. Helping Fund and Kickstart a Climbing Career
4. Dont let consistency turn into monotony! i.e. Do more than indoor gym practices
  a. Taking skill building classes, like learning to Lead Climb.
  b. Participating in External Competitions (like B3 Boston Boulder Brawl) or Externally-hosted Climbing Events.
  c. Outdoor Climbing.
  d. Internally organized events (Holloween Dress Up Climb, Watch Reel Rock XX screenings together)

## Membership 

BOWCO Club
Members are free to climb whenever they would like.

BOWCO Team
Members are required to attend 2 practices per week. 


## Officers and Roles
Our president will be the final decision maker in all matters.  This individual will have an inner-circle of fellow leaders who will plan ad-hoc meetings.  We anticipate a majority of the work in 1) the organization of tryouts 2) structuring practices to match the skill levels and interests of the members 3) setting up internal competitions 4) managing transportation 5) managing funding 6) planning for external competitions.

Under the President, We will also have a leader from each school.

Selected more experienced members will act as mentors to the beginners. Their responsibilities range from giving climbing technique seminars, to just giving simple advice on climbing routes.

Finally, a member will be assigned as coach. This member will be in charge of structuring workouts, 

## Transition Protocol
In the month of December, the president must designate a successor, with nominations from other members, who will take over immediately until the next transition period. This internal transition will help for the new successor to learn the ropes, while the old successor is still there.  At the end of the spring semester, the new president will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has officially occurred.

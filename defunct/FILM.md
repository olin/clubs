# FILM
*Last modified 2017-03-09*

## Purpose
To provide a setting for Olin students to view and discuss well received films that did not reach widespread audiences. FILM meets on Wednesdays at 10:00 pm in the Olin auditorium. The majority of films shown are relatively recent and we are welcome to requests.

## Membership
Membership is very casual. Anyone who attends FILM club showings and/or would like to discuss the films being shown may consider themselves a member.

## Officers and Roles
The head of FILM is known as "FILM Director." The FILM Director ultimately decides the film that will be showing each week, sends out the email, and provides the snacks for each showing.

## Transition Protocol
In April, the FILM Director will send an email to the FILM list to request applications for Director of the following school year. Once the Director has designated a successor, the new FILM Director will inform the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair that the transition has occurred.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The only FILM purchases are in snacks and drinks for the weekly events. These snacks are usually bought in bulk at the start of each month and are meant to provide for ~50 people each week. FILM uses the auditorium on Wednesdays from 10:00 pm - 1:00 am.

## Events and Activities
FILM shows movies on a weekly basis throughout the school year on Wednesdays. It is likely that FILM will collaborate with the cultural clubs(Korean Club, Chinese Club, Indian Club, etc) for special cultural film events.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment is approved by the FILM Director, the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.

## Officers and Roles

President - Manages mailing list, organizes events, oversees budget, appoints other officers as appropriate

## Transition Protocol

In April, a vote will be held to elect the new president. Any member can run, and the candidate with the most votes will take the position the following school year.

Officers are selected by the president at the beginning of the school year, and are usually just those that wish to help out with OPEN activities.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

We have a number of silkscreens to make tshirts with, and other Open swag, held in an East Hall lounge. Most of our purchases will be for food.

## Events and Activities

We have an ongoing bi-monthly movie series, weekly lunches, and other events such as OPEN Mic Nights, and pride flag/t-shirt making sessions.

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments can be proposed at anytime by any member, and there will be a vote at a meeting. If the majority votes for the amendment, it will be passed.

#Jewish Organization at Olin

*Last modified 2016-06-6*

##Purpose
To have an alive Jewish culture on campus. To educate Jews and non-Jews about Jewish culture and practices. To create an environment where Jews feel comfortable.

##Membership
The membership varies. There are generally around 8 core members that come on a regular basis and then anywhere from 5 to 30 other people that show up to events. Our goal is to provide an environment where Jews and non-Jew can come and experience Jewish culture with no commitment. 

##Officers and Roles:
Currently there are two co-presidents. The president(s) of JOO club is in charge of planning events, budgeting and delegating as well as communicating with the CCO or Hillel for needed funding.

There may also be a vice president(s) role whose job it to help the president(s) with planning and exicuting events and also learning in order to maintain some continuity within the club.

##Transition Protocol
The president(s) will be passed down from year to year to a qualified candidate willing to accept the responsibility.  If there are multiple candidates, we will have a discussion/ vote to decide the either who the president is, and whether or not we should have a co-presidency.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We need a little bit of storage space, currently in the closet of EH1. We have in the past made purchases for reusable Judaica. Now we will likely just need funding for events.

##Events and Activities
Often events line up with Holidays. Some events also help students get to Israel or learn more about it. There are also some scattered Jewish culture events.

##Amendment Procedure

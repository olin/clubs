## Purpose
The purpose of Taboo Club is to promote sex positivity and awareness at Olin. There will be a few one time events and monthly events to encourage people to have open conversation about sexuality and educate people about differing opinions or sexual orientations. This is related to the sexuality mailing list. 

## Membership
There are no requirements for membership, all events and activities will be open to the entire school. 

## Officers and Roles
There will be a president who is in charge of organizing events and dealing with finances as well as moderating the sexuality mailing list. The president may add other officers as they see fit. 

## Transition Protocol
At the end of each semester, the president must either decide to continue the following semester or find a replacement to pass both club management and the mailing list to. These do not need to be the same person. 

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Taboo Club will need food for many of its events. The club also owns a collection of books used for events, which require a small amount of storage. The club also owns a small collection of rope. As new events are proposed, the club may need some funding for small purchases. 

## Events and Activities
We will hold somewhat regular discussions of topics related to sexuality. There will also be a few events throughout the year such as bringing in speakers to teach classes or a scavenger hunt. 

## Amendment Procedure
If the changes need to be made they must be approved by the president and at least 50% of any other officers who are part of the club at the time.

#Glass Club
*Last modified 2016-08-09*

##Purpose
Glass Club is created to provide students with the opportunity to work molten glass. Glass-working is an amazing fusion of concepts that takes knowledge from chemistry, physics and art to excel. We focus on small-scale "lampworking" (forming glass with a torch) to further our education in the fine arts.

##Membership
Any student can join the Glass Club. In order to participate in glass-making activities, members will have to go through a safety briefing with glass club leadership. People will be considered active members if they attend at least 50% of events. Members must help set up or clean up everytime at glass club meetings to remain members.

##Officers and Roles
There are two positions in Glass Club: President and general member. The role of the President (one or more individuals) is responsible for organizing meetings and events, managing purchasing requests, appointing positions for the following year, managing the club supplies (storage, what to buy, etc.), teaching new members fundamentals of glass-making, and is the prime person responsible for the safety of the club's members. They establish and enforce safety protocol, sets up (and takes down) the torches and gas cylinders or delegate it to another member trained in the proper safety protocol.

##Transition Protocol
The president will name the leadership of the following year. Other members of the club can pitch their ideas or nominations, but it is ultimately up to the president. Presidents can name as many members President as they deem necessary to run the club.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Glass club requires oxy-propane torches, glass rods, tubes, glass-forming tools and gas and oxygen supply. Gas is obtained through the natural gas supply in the materials science lab (AC413). Oxygen cylinders are stored in AC409 and are transported from there to AC 413 for lampworking. Regulators for oxygen tanks are stored in AC413. The consumable materials, torches and tools will be stored with the President until a more permanent storage space can be obtained. As stated before, the President will be in charge of purchases. Any member of the club is welcome to use materials for glass working as long as they have the permission of the President.

##Events and Activities
Events will be held whenever the President feels like it. They will be held on approximately a weekly basis.

##Amendment Procedure
At any point during the semester, members of the club can propose an amendment to the charter. If that amendment is approved by at least 50% of active members (including at least one President), it is law.

### Purpose
The purpose of the Olin SWE Chapter is to provide Olin students (of all genders) that are interested in promoting women in engineering with professional development opportunities and mentorship.

### Membership
Membership is open to all Olin students.

### Officers and Roles
The Olin SWE chapter has an executive board made up of 4 individuals: President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary
  
### Funds
The Olin SWE Members will fundraise throughout the year to raise money for the chapter. This money, in addition to the rebate from the national SWE organization will be used to fund the annual trip to the national SWE  conference. The rebate arrives every semester as part of being an official SWE chapter. Furthermore, donations and grant awards will also be used to fund this trip.

The chapter will also use funds from  CCO to support local chapter meeting supplies and campus activities for members.


### Transition Protocols
Elections for executive board positions are held at the end of spring semester each year. First, students are nominated for positions, then all SWE members vote. Executive board members should not be Seniors.

### Events and Activities
SWE hosts a number of professional development activities for members each year. The biggest is participation in the SWE National Conference. This is a large conference with an extensive career fair and many workshops. In addition, SWE hosts resume workshops and company visits throughout the year.

### Amendment Procedure
All SWE members are welcome to propose updates to the charter at any point. Updates will be reviewed by the board and then shared with the rest of the group.

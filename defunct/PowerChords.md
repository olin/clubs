# PowerChords Charter Update FA2019

Last Updated: September 9, 2019

## I. Mission Statement

The **PowerChords** promise to bring quality a cappella music to Olin both through our own performances and the performances of the groups we invite to sing with at our concerts. As a group, our mission is to have fun through music and to improve as musicians, performers, and singers. We promise to contribute to the arts presence on Olin's campus and provide an opportunity for qualified musicians to have a rigorous and fun musical experience that can be shared with their peers.

## II. Officers (The PowerBoard)

PowerChords officers are group members that are either elected or appointed, and are responsible for maintaining, running, and expanding PowerChords.

### 1. The Executive Board

The executive board of PowerChords is a subset of the PowerBoard, and consists of three elected officers: President, Music Director, and Assistant Music Director.

The **Music Director (MD)** oversees all musical aspects of PowerChords. This means scheduling out the musical aspects of the semester, running rehearsals, choosing a song list, designating arrangers, improving arrangements (before the group begins learning the arrangements), influencing piece leaders, planning concert music order, auditioning new members, auditioning and designating soloists, teaching music concepts, and running outside of rehearsal individual work.

The MD should also train an **Assistant Music Director (AMD)** who helps musically run the group, particularly if the MD is absent (1). The MD dictates what tasks the AMD is responsible for throughout the semester, and, before the end of the semester, the AMD should be capable of performing any of the MD's tasks.

The **President** represents PowerChords and manages the group. The President also acts as the Internal Business Manager, who organizes and runs the group with the MD. The President is in charge of the PowerBoard and delegates tasks while ensuring that those tasks are completed. All officers report to the President on a bi-weekly basis (2).

### 2. The PowerBoard

Beyond the Executive Board, the rest of the PowerBoard is comprised of officers appointed by the Executive Board. It is strongly recommended that there are at least 3 people not a part of the Executive Board in the PowerBoard, suggested positions are as follows: External Business Manager, Publicity, Treasurer, CD Manager, Alumni Coordinator, Webmaster, and Historian (3). All officers report to the President on a bi-weekly basis (2).

The **(External) Business Manager** manages the PowerChords Gmail account, which includes responding to all emails and forwarding emails to other officers as appropriate. The External Business Manager is also the point person for coordinating with groups to schedule PowerChords events (on and off campus), applying to competitions, and inviting/securing/hosting other a capella groups to perform at PowerChords concerts.

**Publicity** manages PowerChords' external image. This includes advertising PowerChords events, recording major concerts, creating and posting fliers around campus, creating and submitting digital fliers for displays in the Dining Hall and Milas Hall, creating and sending invitations to faculty for concerts, and managing the PowerChords Facebook and Twitter accounts.

The **Treasurer** manages the finances for PowerChords. This includes selling merchandise, handling donations/raising money, submitting line items to spend money, checking in about reimbursements, and keeping track of the dollar balance of the PowerChords bank account.

The **CD Manager** manages existing albums and works with the MD on producing new albums and releasing new singles. If applicable, this includes helping to create a cohesive vision for an album, choosing songs to be recorded, scheduling time/coordinating with a studio, choosing a recording order for live studio, finalizing details on a new album, and submitting for production.

The **Alumni Coordinator** keeps in touch with PowerChords alumni to help expand and maintain our alumni network. Someday, the Alumni Coordinator may plan an alumni event or concert or use alumni for fundraising for PowerChords.

The **Webmaster** manages the PowerChords website and YouTube video uploads. They will also be responsible for online interactions separate from our email, Facebook, and Twitter accounts.

The **Historian** records information about PowerChords to build a club history. The audience for these documents is future PowerChords officers interested in how things were done in the past so that they can learn and build a better future for PowerChords.

### 3. Officer Transitions

All officers must provide their replacement with an updated transition document based on their experience. Outgoing officers must speak with their replacement officers before leaving campus for the end of the semester.

### 4. Section Notes

1. If the group has Co-Music Directors, then there will not be an Assistant Music Director.
2. Every other week.
3. It is recommended that these positions be distributed in the following combinations: Treasurer/CD Manager and Alumni Coordinator/Historian.

## III. Elections and Appointments for Officer Positions

As laid out in Section II, PowerChords has a leadership team comprising of three elected officers (The Executive Board) and appointed officers. The sitting president administers all election processes (1). Elections for the following semester's officers will be held after the final concert for the semester (2).

### 1. Election Procedures

Before each election takes place, the sitting president will set a reasonable deadline for prospective Executive Board candidates to submit a written statement explaining why they are running. Candidates must submit this written statement to the sitting President before the deadline set by the President, and the President will send these statements to the group for review before elections take place.

Elections for Music Director, if occurring, should be held first. Elections for President and Assistant Music Director can then follow (3).

Elections for MD should be preceded by a brief trial rehearsal run by each of the candidates. Elections for the President should be preceded by a brief group discussion run by the candidates. After all trial rehearsals or group discussions have been run, it is recommended to allow at least 24 hours pass before the election takes place. It is also recommended that a period of at least 12 hours be allowed to pass between any election and the written statement deadline for the next set of elections.

For President, MD, and AMD elections, the group will meet, final statements for each candidate will be given, and then a group discussion without the candidates present will occur.  Voting will then take place in a secret ballot or blind excellence voting form (4).  Winning candidates will be announced as soon as votes are counted.

The candidate with the most votes will be elected for the following term.  In the case of a tie, candidates who have the most votes shall participate in a runoff election.  Voters will choose only one candidate in the runoff election.

Two members may run as Co-Directors. Both members must enter this agreement willingly. They must write and submit a statement together and they must co-direct a trial rehearsal. Co-Directors will not be considered as individual candidates.  Election procedures are the same as originally stated.

### 2. Appointment Procedures

Non-Executive Board PowerBoard positions (e.g. Business Manager and Publicity) are appointed by a majority vote of the following semester's Executive Board. Before the appointments are made, the sitting President will set a reasonable deadline for prospective PowerBoard candidates to submit a written statement explaining why they are running. Candidates must submit this written statement before the deadline set by the President, and PowerChords will be given an opportunity to review the statements and provide feedback to the newly elected or reelected MD, AMD, and President before the appointments are made.

These additional PowerBoard officers should be appointed by the newly elected or reelected MD, AMD, and President within two weeks of the MD election (5).

### 3. Officer Eligibility Requirements

- No candidates may plan on studying away in the semester for which they are running.
- If a student in their second to last semester at Olin holds the position of MD or President and the group is confident in a younger candidate, then the MD or President must step down in their last semester at Olin. The new MD or President can then use the outgoing MD and President as resources. The MD and President may continue their duties for the purposes of a competition until the competition is complete to ensure continuity.

### 4. Section Notes

1. If the current president is running for a position, they will submit their statement to the MD, who will compile and send out the candidate statements for that position.
2. The MD will have elections yearly (after the Spring concert) instead of semesterly. The exception to this is if the MD steps down at the end of the Fall semester. All other officer positions require elections every semester.
3. All candidates for President and AMD must be willing to work closely with the elected MD. Note that these two elections may take place in the same election session.
4. Blind excellence voting means that a current Executive Board member will count excellence votes (which can be shown with the raise of a hand) while everyone else has their eyes closed.
5. These candidates must be willing to work with the elected President. Note that these appointments may also take place in the same election session.

## IV. Impeachment

At any time, any member of the club may call for an impeachment of any current officer by notifying the President or MD.  An impeachment meeting must be held within three PowerChords rehearsals, may occur during a PowerChords rehearsal, and should be advertised at least 48 hours in advance. The member who called for the impeachment and the officer to be impeached must agree upon an impartial member of the club to hold the impeachment meeting and count the secret ballots.  A two-thirds majority is required to remove the officer in question. If the officer is impeached, a special election must be held immediately after the impeachment proceedings, moderated by the same impartial member, to appoint a different member of the club to the position (1).

### 1. Section Notes

1. Or, if that member is running for office, that member’s appointee.

## V. Membership

To become a member of the club, any student at Olin may audition for PowerChords. The MD will run auditions and choose new members for PowerChords. All members have the right to vote and run for office (1).

PowerChords members are required to attend at least 85% of total held rehearsals. This is to ensure that members are dedicated to the music and to the group. If at any point during the semester after 14 rehearsals, a member misses more than 15% of total rehearsals thus far, they will be required to re-audition for membership in the group at the end of the semester and must be notified at least five class days in advance. Members are also required to perform at PowerChords concerts when they are scheduled at least two weeks in advance and they have not notified the MD of a conflict in their schedule. Exceptions can be granted if both the President and the MD approve and will only be granted if the reason for missing rehearsal or performance was due to an emergency situation.

Rehearsals may be cancelled by the MD or President under special circumstances. At the beginning of the semester the President will establish a set of guidelines for details on how attendance will be counted. The President will make these guidelines available for viewing by the rest of the group. Appendix A contains a suggested set of guidelines.

### 1. Section Notes

1. If a member is no longer going to be in the group in the following semester, they may not vote during elections for that semester's officers.

## VI. Distribution of Solos

Solos in songs can be categorized as either major solos or minor solos. It is up to each MD to decide what differentiates the two. Major solos can be further categorized into pre-assigned solos and auditioned solos.

### 1. Minor Solos

All minor solos will be assigned solely by the MD(s). MDs are not required to hold auditions for minor solos.   There is no limit on the number of minor solos any group member can have; however, MDs should seek to distribute these evenly among all group members.

### 2. Pre-assigned (Major) Solos

Every semester there will be a set of pre-assigned group members who will be given a solo. The purpose of these solos is to give every group member an opportunity to have a major solo for a song that he/she is passionate and excited about.

Pre-assigned solos will be distributed as follows:

1. Every sophomore who joined the group during their freshman year will be given a pre-assigned solo in the Spring semester. 
2. Unless this is their first semester in PowerChords, every senior will be given a pre-assigned solo in the Fall semester. 

Members who have a pre-assigned solo the following semester will be required to give the MD(s) a list of 3 to 8 songs that they wish to solo on at least a month prior to the end of the semester. Failure to do so may result in the loss of the solo. Soloists also have the option of choosing to share the solo with other members of their choosing. The MD(s) will then become familiar with the suggested songs and will work with the soloist to determine which of the possible songs will be a best fit for the soloist and for the group. MDs should choose a song that the soloist is passionate and excited about, and the song should be a good fit for the soloist. MDs should determine what key the song should be in and should find an arranger, or pre-existing arrangement, for the soloist. At the end of this process the MD(s) and soloists should be in agreement about the choice of song, arranger, and key.

After the final concert the MD(s) will submit a list of pre-assigned soloists and their respective songs, arrangers, and keys to the group for final approval. The group will listen to each soloist sing an excerpt of their song in the proposed key, either live or via recording, and should only reject song choices if they believe the song will be of much lower quality than the group’s other songs. MDs are strongly advised not to determine the rest of the semester’s songs until after the group has agreed on all of the pre-assigned solos.

During the break between semesters, arrangers should present multiple drafts of arrangements to MD(s) and soloists and should be very open to feedback.

All pre-assigned soloists will have their songs performed at the semester’s final concert. Seniors will additionally have their pre-assigned solos performed again in the Spring semester concert during the “Senior Send-Off.” These songs will be retired at the end of this semester to honor the graduated senior.

### 3. Auditioned (Major) Solos

If any other songs contain a major solo, the MD(s) and AMD will chose a soloist based on auditions. Auditions will be held before the group begins work on the song, or very shortly after. These auditions will be held during rehearsal to give all members an opportunity to audition and provide feedback. The MD(s), AMD, and arranger of the song must be present for all of the auditions, except in extreme circumstances. Solos will be chosen based on merit shown during the audition and based on the solo distribution rules outlined in the next section.

It is strongly recommended that the MD also chooses an understudy for each major solo. The understudy can sing the solo during a performance when the main soloist is unable to perform. The understudy soloist should also be given the opportunity of having the solo in minor performances and future semesters.

### 4. Rules and Guidelines for the Distribution of Solos

Any member of the group can have an absolute maximum of two major solos per semester. (This does not include being an understudy for a major solo.) MDs are strongly advised to limit each member to only one major solo per semester.

## VII. Competition and Culture

Before the spring semester ends, the President must lead a group discussion or discussions about attending competitions the following year. A majority of the returning members of the group must be present, and the group should decide whether or not PowerChords attends a competition and what attitude PowerChords will have towards that competition. Excellence based voting is strongly suggested, but not mandated.

The key with these discussions is to be as specific as possible to set expectations for the following year. For example, the group can decide to attend ICCAs and take a "we're going to rock this!" attitude, which means that an extra weekly rehearsal will be added during the spring semester before competition happens to enable significant polishing of a set while adding choreography. This is not only helpful for current members to decide whether or not they want to remain in the group, but also helpful for recruiting new members in the fall. Having the discussion in the spring semester avoids putting pressure on new members who may have no experience with collegiate a capella competition and the culture of PowerChords to make a decision. When new members decide to join the group, they then opt-in to the decision the group makes at the end of the spring semester and expectations about time commitment and attitude are clear. 

### 1. Section Notes

1. It is strongly encouraged for the President to schedule a dedicated, in person feedback session at the end of every semester for individual Executive Board members, PowerBoard, and the group as a whole. While the President has discretion on whether or not that feedback session happens at the semester, happens multiple times a semester, or does not happen at all, the President should try to solicit feedback from the group at all times. The discussion about competition and culture that is mandated by this charter can be added to one of these discussion sessions or be kept separately.

## VIII. Charter Revising

After the Spring semester of every even year, this charter will be put up for revision. The purposes of these revisions are 1) to allow for current sections of the charter to be improved upon and cleaned up, 2) to address emerging issues, 3) to allow for the implementation of multi-year experimental policies, and 4) to assess and reevaluate our goals and purpose as a group.

It will be the job of the incoming President to carry out the revision, but this President is allowed and strongly recommended to enlist the help of the incoming MD(s) and the outgoing officers in writing the new charter. Before the beginning of the Fall semester, the incoming President should have a completed draft of the charter ready for the groups approval.

Once the Fall semester begins, the group has one month from the first day of rehearsal to ratify the new charter. Ratification requires two-thirds majority vote of all current group members. All sections of the charter need to be ratified; however, different sections can be ratified at different times (1).  It is suggested that the President present each section to the group and lead discussion. A section should not be voted on until 24 hours after the initial presentation. When every section has been ratified, the President will submit the new charter to the Committee for Clubs and Organizations. The old charter will remain in effect until the new charter is ratified.

If the group fails to ratify the charter within a month, the old charter will remain in place for the remainder of the semester. The President will then start the charter revision process again at the conclusion of the semester.

### 1. Section Notes

1. It is strongly encouraged that each section is ratified independently to evenly space the process.

## IX. Appendix

### A. Suggested Attendance Policy Details, Final Attendance Policy to be Determined by President

The President (or designated member) is in charge of recording rehearsal attendance. The following guidelines are a suggestion that the President may choose to follow and must present to the group in the first week of rehearsals.

- Star = early/right on time, Check = mostly on time (up to three minutes late)
- l = 4-15 minutes late
- L = missed more than 15 minutes of rehearsal (either arrived late, left early, or missed part)
- a = absent (informed),  A = uninformed absence


- A star, check , l, L count as +1
- An ‘a’ counts as 0.
- A member will be charged with minus one rehearsal for every ten “l” they receive and/or every three “L” they receive and/or every uninformed absence (“A”) they receive. In order to avoid an uninformed absence, a member should notify all MD(s) and President 48 hours before that rehearsal (ideally ASAP though). In the event of an emergency or sickness, a member may notify after this 48 hours and not be penalized, to the judgment of the MD(s)/President.

Alternatively:

- +1 = early/right on time
- +0.9 = 4-15 minutes late
- 0 = absent (informed)
- -1 = uninformed absence

15% of the total rehearsals should be calculated and noted by the President.

The President should check that missed rehearsal attributed to one member are spread throughout the semester, rather than concentrated at one length of time, as to avoid a member missing instruction on a specific song. After 14 rehearsals, any member that has not met the current attendance requirement percentage will have to re-audition for the group, lose a solo, and/or lose the privilege of singing a song with the group. This is up to the discretion of the MD(s) and President but will be acted upon in at least one way.

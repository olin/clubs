# Olin Fire Arts Club (OFAC)
*Last modified 2016-08-09*

## Purpose

Teach and foster fire arts at Olin.

## Membership

Members attend practice once a week and burns every other week, and we do performances for candidates weekend and family weekend. Members don't need to attend every practice to burn.

## Officers and Roles

President and Vice President (Firelord and Vice Firelord). 

## Transition Protocol

In April members nominate for president and VP and then there is a vote.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

We use a budget of $1500 annually, about $750-$1000 of which is spent on fuel, while the rest is spent on props or club events like Wildfire.

## Events and Activities

We have a weekly practice and a biweekly burn on Friday nights. We also have performances for family weekend in the fall, and candidates' weekends in the spring. We will occasionally also do performances at Wellesley or other places. Sometimes we coordinate local trips to relevant events, like spin jams or Wildfire.

## Amendment Procedure

If the president wants an amendment they write it up and send it into CCO for approval. Anyone can propose an amendment.
